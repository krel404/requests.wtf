Requests is a community-sourced list of ideas worth exploring for makers in the Nouns ecosystem.


---
### Requests
- Nouns-only farcaster client for iOS
- Make it easy for anyone to submit new noun traits via proposal
- Build new Prop House experiences/clients on top of the contracts
- Make it easier for the dao to keep track of and understand ongoing payment streams
- Help non-nouners better understand the proposal process and get them to create and submit good proposals
- Make it easier for new devs to build on top of Nouns
- Find ways to increase voter participation
- Get more people to publish content around nouns (essays, art, etc)
- Figure out how to measure growth for Nouns. Can we find a metric for 'true fans' and 'players' and a reliable way to measure it?
- Low-cap (retro) funding -- figure out a process for distributing 0.5e range to large amount of makers
- Analytics platform -- create a dashboard that provides a birds-eye-view of nouns financials, spend rate, etc
