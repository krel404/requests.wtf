Requests is a community-sourced list of ideas worth exploring for makers in the Nouns ecosystem.

### Requests
- **Client for proposal and candidate submission**
  - To date, the DAO only has one interface for proposal submission (nouns.wtf), which is centrally controlled by the Nouns Foundation. A diversity of prop submission clients would help the DAO accelerate decentralization of all contract touch-points.

- **Governance-focused app/PWA**
  - A mobile app, or PWA, focused on day-to-day DAO governance.

- **No-code trait submissions**
  - Submitting new traits to the DAO is cumbersome and a tall ask for anyone without significant knowledge about the Descriptor contract. Making it easy for anyone to propose artwork would go a long way towards further decentralization and breaking down the current norms around trait submission.
  - There are many facets to this problem, including contract work, an intuitive user interface, how to legally sign away artwork as cc0, automated(?) testing/QA, as well as the ability to not just submit new traits, but change or retire existing traits, too.

- **Prop House client diversity**
  - The Prop House protocol is underway and expected to launch soon. This will allow for anyone to build clients and interfaces on top of the core Prop House protocol functionality.
- **Retro funding 2.0**
  - One of the best early features of Nouns was its commitment to and generous relationship with retroactive compensation. Its not clear what a sufficiently decentralized and functional retro funding arm would look like, but its a design space worth exploring that, if done right, can bring a lot of value to the DAO.

- **Proposer funnel**
  - One way to think about the Nouns DAO onboarding process is as a funnel with a wide top and narrow bottom. At the top of the funnel, it should be maximally easy for new ‘players’ to find, learn about, and start engaging with the DAO. At the bottom, we have successfully passed proposals.
  - Its unclear what the sections in-between look like, creating ample opportunity for anyone to explore this design space and help move users down the funnel. Either via software and automated solutions, or hands-on personalized efforts and services.
- **Financial dashboard**
  - A governance client focused on financial insights. Can display metrics like treasury income and spend rate over time. Could provide insights on teams we fund continuously (eg nounish, verbs, esports) and what that expenditure looks like annually or monthly.
  - Ideas from elad:
    - All assets held by the DAO denominated in USD and ETH
    - All past payments denominated in both currencies, while taking into account that converting to stETH is not a 'payment' etc..
    - All streams and their status
- **Growth tracker**
  - Nouns does not have a reliable way to measure ‘growth’ or ‘success’. Its not clear what should be measured, or what growth in the context of Nouns even means. That is part of the problem to be solved. Any headway made on this issue could have an outsized positive impact on Nouns.
  - Example KPIs by Noun40 (https://warpcast.com/noun40/0x59cebf7c) that can act as a starting point for exploration.

- **Nouns-channel-only farcaster client**
  - With the right tweaks, Warpcast already works almost as a dedicated Nouns client. But there is probably an opportunity to go even deeper here and build, from the group up, a custom client just for Nouns.
- **Nouns L2 (OP-stack)**
  - tbd
- **Payment streams dedicated client**
  - Client to view and interact with proposer payment streams-
